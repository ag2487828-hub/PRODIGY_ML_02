🛍 Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project was developed as part of my Machine Learning Internship at Prodigy Infotech.
The aim is to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history using the K-Means Clustering algorithm.

📌 Project Overview

Implemented K-Means Clustering to perform customer segmentation.
Dataset contains details like Annual Income and Spending Score of customers.
used the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
Visualized the clusters to identify high-value, moderate, and low-spending customers.

⚙️ Technologies & Libraries
Python
Pandas & NumPy → Data preprocessing & handling
Scikit-learn → K-Means implementation
Matplotlib & Seaborn → Data visualization


🚀 Steps to Run the Project

1)Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name

2)Install required libraries
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

3)Run the Jupyter Notebook / Python script
jupyter notebook Customer_Segmentation.ipynb


📊 Results

Customers were successfully segmented into 5 distinct clusters.
Each cluster represents a group of customers with similar income levels and spending behaviors.
These insights can help businesses with personalized marketing strategies and customer retention.
